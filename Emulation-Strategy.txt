As previously explained, the electrical behavior of a photovoltaic (PV) panel is generally represented by its **current–voltage (I–V) characteristic curve**, as illustrated in the next figure:



In this figure, four key parameters can be identified:

- **V_{oc}**: Open-circuit voltage  
- **I_{sc}**: Short-circuit current  
- **V_{MPP}**: Voltage at the maximum power point  
- **I_{MPP}**: Current at the maximum power point  

These parameters mainly depend on the intrinsic properties of the PV cells. However, external factors such as **shading, temperature, and environmental conditions** can also affect the overall performance of the module.  

The **maximum power point (MPP)**, represented by the coordinates (I_{MPP}, V_{MPP}) in the I–V plane, corresponds to the operating point at which the **product of current and voltage is maximized**.  

This curve can be modeled using mathematical functions, and several models have been proposed in the literature.
