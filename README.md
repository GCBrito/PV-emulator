# PV-emulator

This repository provides algorithms and resources to use an OwTech board as a **photovoltaic (PV) emulator**.  
It includes the following folders:

- **Single-diode model** — the most complete version of the PV emulator.  
- **Simplified exponential model** — a simpler version of the PV emulator.  
- **Experimental data** — all datasets from laboratory tests.  
- **MATLAB comparison** — an algorithm to evaluate and compare the performance of all emulators.
